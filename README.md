# dota_2_win_strategy_model
 This repository is a personal project that will guide in-game and in-real time, the optimal strategy to succeed given the circumstances of the game.

The process to achieve this is by first developing a machine learning model using data acquired from the OpenDota API (https://docs.opendota.com/). Secondly, in-game data will be acquired using a python screenshot automated script that will gather my personal in-game data. I will then use object detection and recognition to translate in-game data to text and numbers at different intervals.

Finally, both the sets of data will be brough together to get some actionable stratgeies in-game.

I have never done something of this nature before so it will be an iterative process. Bringing the ideas in my head to life might be more challenging when actually implementing them. Therefore, this project will be an iterative process in which the ultimate goals will be reevaluated every now and then and updated here.

Low-hanging fruits: Estimating the networth difference between the teams live. Most effective heroes on the map at a given time and to play around them.
